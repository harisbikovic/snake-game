[32m+[m[32m## Description[m
[32m+[m
[32m+[m[32mThe game consists of a player-controlled snake that moves around the screen, trying to eat food pellets that appear at random locations. Each time the snake eats a pellet, it grows longer, making it harder to avoid running into itself. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or with the screen's border.[m

[32m+[m[32m## How to Play[m
[32m+[m
[32m+[m[32mThe player uses the arrow keys to move the snake around the screen. The snake will move continuously in the direction it's facing until it hits a wall or a body segment. The objective is to eat as much food as possible without crashing.[m
